   Terminal-chat is light chat communicator that can be hosted on MySQL Databases.
  You can use it "worldwide" by using shared online database.

  Also, you can use chat "inside". By hosting app on MySQL Database not shared online,
  you will have 100% privacy, because data won't go out from the private network.

  It may be good option for simple chatting inside company / corporation.

  App allows to create private and group chats. Also adding and removing users from them,
  with keeping messages history.

  Keep in mind that unregistering account makes it never reacheable again.

  Enjoy using it!
